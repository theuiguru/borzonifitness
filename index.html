    <p>Here are some questions to ask yourself to help decide if working with a personal trainer is right for you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are you unsure of where to start to achieve your fitness goals?</li>
      <li>Do you lack the motivation to exercise?</li>
      <li>Is it too expensive to join a gym AND have a personal trainer?</li>
      <li>Are you currently exercising but not seeing the results you desire?</li>
      <li>Are you sick of the same old exercise routine?</li>
      <li>Do you find it difficult to stick to your program?</li>
      <li>Do you have an event coming up you want to look good for?</li>
      <li>Are you ready to achieve the body you have always dreamed of?</li>
    </ul><p>If you answered yes to any of these questions, then a personal trainer may be the right decision for you.</p>
